# minimal

A *very* minimalistic theme for LaTeX beamer. It’s literally just black and white. So far I’ve used it in four presentations 
and three out of four professors didn’t tell me it’s ugly.

## How to use

Drop the .sty files of this project in your working directory, add ```\usetheme{minimal}``` right beneath your ```\documentclass{beamer}``` et voilà!
